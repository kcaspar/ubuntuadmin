create online repository "ubuntuadmin"
no need to fork
go to local Documents folder
git clone https://github.com/kcaspar/ubuntuadmin.git
this clones the empty "ubuntuadmin" repository into the Documents folder
copy files into the newly created ubuntuadmin folder
cd into ubuntuamdin
git add *
this adds all new files to the repository
git commit
failed, since git was not configured, hence:
git config --global user.name "kcaspar"
git config --global user.email "kcukmail@yahoo.com"
git commit
now succeeds
git status - lists all files and that they are one commit ahead of online repository
git push
this synchronizes the commited files to the online repository
added the new github text file, after push the temp git.txt~ appears.
git rm git.txt~ locally removes it from the list
commit and push deletes the file online too

to avoid the user/pwd entry - crate a ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "kcukmail@yahoo.com"
this creates a ssh key, need to provide a passphrase
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
this comes back with an agent pid
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
this adds the key, after entering the passphrase
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
this lists the key
add this key to github under personal settings/ssh keys, when copy include the rsa-key in the beginning
after adding the same number should show up as when creating the key

ssh -T git@github.com
this tests the connection, spits out warnings (such as host unknown, dont have shell acess...)

now switch from https to ssh

git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/kcaspar/ubuntuadmin.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/kcaspar/ubuntuadmin.git (push)
this lists the push and pull origins on github

use set url to switch to ssh:     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY2.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:kcaspar/ssh://github.com/kcaspar/ubuntuadmin.git
check if changed: git remote -v, it did

now try and push without pwd....
didn't work - came up with some fatal: I don't handle protocol 'git@github.com:..../ssh'
crap must have happened when changing to ssh
edit .git/config under origin, change the url =  ... 
url = ssh://git@github.com/kcaspar/ubuntuadmin.git

then git push worked!

git commit
git commit -m "Adding files"
git commit -a -m "Changed some files"
git commit -m "change some files" file1 file2
