#install cudaNN, accelerator for NNets
# tf wants 7.0, the matching version for cuda 9.0 is cudann 7.04
# it seems only the runtime library is required - tbc
# download: libcudnn7_7.0.5.15-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb

# to install:
sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7_7.0.5.15-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb
#this finished easily


#sudo apt-cache search cuda-command-line-tool, then install the correct version
#cuda-command-line-tools-8-0
# this was installed already

============================================================






first teh runtime library
sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7_7.1.1.5-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb
- other: sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7_7.1.1.5-1+cuda9.1_amd64.deb

second the dev libray, 7.1 didn't work because tf wanted 6.0
once I run the installer it worked, it seem the installer only copies the include, lib files to the cuda location
hence if a new cudann is required, it may be enoug to just run the appropriate installer
cudann 6.0, download and install
sudo dpkg -i libcudnn6_6.0.21-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7-dev_7.1.1.5-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb 
- other: sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7-dev_7.1.1.5-1+cuda9.1_amd64.deb


5. toolkits etc

sudo apt-cache search cuda-command-line-tool, then install the correct version
cuda-command-line-tools-8-0

the tf install guid is wornt (sudo apt-get install cuda-command-line-tools)
add the path to the bash:
/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64




then 





cudann:
download the cudann_6_for_8_0 library
unzip with
tar -xvzf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v6.0.tgz
this only includes the include and lib64 dirs, it is assumed that the rest is available (look at the /usr/local/cuda dir for what else is installed with deb, eg. the )
create specific dir with and move it to the /usr/local 
mv cuda cudann_6_for_8_0
mv cudann_6_for_8_0 /usr/local
